TOILETRY POUCH ON CHAIN

$1,760.00

The Toiletry Pouch On Chain was inspired by the Monogram Toiletry Pouch cosmetic pouch, created in 1901, which Louis Vuitton clients also used as a clutch. 
This reworked design adds a removable chain and refined natural leather trim to create a fashionable bag, which can be carried in the hand or on the shoulder.
 Concealed inside is a smaller version of the pouch, which can also be used separately.
