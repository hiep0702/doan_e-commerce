IRIS XS WALLET

$830.00

Small enough to slip into any bag, the Iris XS wallet comes in Louis Vuitton's signature Mahina calf leather with Monogram perforations. 
The soft, supple leather gives this wallet a light, feminine feel. 
Its rounded flap opens to reveal a space-efficient interior with credit-card slots, a gusseted coin pocket and a pocket for banknotes.
