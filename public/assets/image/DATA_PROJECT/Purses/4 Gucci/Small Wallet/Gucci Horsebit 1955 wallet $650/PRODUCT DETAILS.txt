Presenting fashion as everlasting rather than seasonal, elements synonymous with the House are highlighted throughout the Epilogue collection. The Gucci Horsebit 1955 wallet combines the House's monogram canvas with a symbol from its equestrian past, drawing two elements of the brand's roots together. The style is completed with brown leather details that draw attention to the Horsebit detail.
