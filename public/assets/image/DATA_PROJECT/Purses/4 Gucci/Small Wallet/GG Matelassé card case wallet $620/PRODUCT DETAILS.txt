Matelassé leather continues to come to the fore of the Creative Director's designs in unique ways each season. With a super soft finish, the signature material is reimagined with a textured geometric motif as a part of the small leather accessories line. The design presents a contemporary approach to the '90s logo trend, here it defines a black card case wallet.
