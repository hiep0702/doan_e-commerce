Style ‎621887 LU3XG 2535
Introduced within the Gucci Horsebit 1955 accessories collection, this wallet is presented in brown python. The line is defined by the same double bar and ring design that is found within handbags—a detail that is part of Gucci's genetic code and established as one of the most distinctive elements among the House symbols borrowed from the equestrian world.
